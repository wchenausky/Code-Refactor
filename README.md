# Code Refactor

I've started this project to help better understand what my day to day work will be like once I'm in the field. Here I've been given a set of HTML and CSS with some errors in them. I will go through step by step of how I fixed these errors and gave the wedsite a live URL.

## Steps For Giving The Webite A Stand Alone URL
1. Open Github.com
2. Open the repository for project
3. Open the settings link
4. Scroll down towards the bottom till you see "Git Hub Pages"
5. Set your URL through github using your github username and the name of the project.
6. Click to add a "README.md file"

## How To Get The "Search Engine Optimization" Link To Work
1. I noticed the "Search Engine Optimization" line did not have an id
2. Add the id to navigate to the "search Engine Optimizaion" section.

## Add Class Tag And Change Exiting Class Tag In HTML To Help Consoliate CSS Properties
1.  Add class tag class=service to search engine opimization
2. Change class tag online-rputation-managment to class=services
3. Change class tag social-media-marketing to class=services

## Combining CSS Propertirs For The Class For Services
1. Combine the class for search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-managment, social-media-marketin to be all inclusive to the class .services
2. Combine the class for search-engine-optimization h2, online-reputation-managment h2, social-media-marketing h2.to be all inclusive to the class .services h2
3. Combine the class for search-engine-optimization img, online-reputation-managment img, social-media-marketing img to be all inclusive to the class .services img.

## Combining CSS Properties For The Class For Benefit
1. Combine the class for benefit-lead h3, benefit-brand h3, benefit-cost h3 to benefit-all h3
2. Combine the class for benefit-lead, benefit-brand, benefit-cost to benefit-all
3. Combine the class for benefit-lead img, benefit-brandimg img, benefit-cost img to benefit-all img
